    "Smoothing is  used to reduce noise within an image or to produce a less pixelated image. Most smoothing methods are based on low pass filters.  Smoothing is also usually based on a single value representing the image, such as the average value of the image or the middle (median) value. There are alsso blur techniues such as Gaussian Blur which basically involves blurring an image through a Gaussian Function."

The paper though succeeds in idefect detection quite often but does not provide a walk through approach and thus, requires tuning of the parameters involved in its implementation. "
